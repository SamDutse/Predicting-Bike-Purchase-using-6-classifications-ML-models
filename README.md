**Predicting Bike Purchase**

**Project Overview:**

Welcome to the Predicting Bike Purchase project! This GitHub repository contains a comprehensive analysis of customer behavior and purchase patterns in relation to bike buying decisions. The project employs machine learning techniques such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to predict whether a customer will purchase a bike based on their demographic and behavioral characteristics. The dataset used in this project includes a variety of features such as marital status, income, education, occupation, and more.

**Project Structure:**

- **Dataset:** The project begins by loading and exploring the dataset, which includes information about customers' demographics and purchasing behavior.

- **Data Preprocessing:** Various preprocessing steps are applied, including handling missing values, removing duplicates, and converting categorical variables into numerical format.

- **Data Visualization:** The dataset's characteristics are visualized through bar plots, histograms, and correlation matrices to gain insights into the distribution and relationships between different features.

- **Data Analysis:** Statistical analyses are conducted to explore the mean income across different categories, such as marital status, gender, education, occupation, commute distance, and region.

- **Machine Learning Models:** Four machine learning classification models are trained and evaluated using the dataset: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and KNN.

**Findings:**

1. The accuracy scores achieved by the different machine learning models are as follows:
   - Logistic Regression: 62.27%
   - Decision Tree: 55%
   - Random Forest: 70%
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): 60%
   
   Among these models, the Random Forest model achieved the highest accuracy, making it the most suitable model for predicting bike purchases in this context.

2. The dataset's visualizations and analyses reveal valuable insights:
   - Customers with higher income levels are more likely to purchase bikes.
   - Married individuals and females show a higher tendency to buy bikes.
   - Education, occupation, and region also influence bike purchasing decisions.
